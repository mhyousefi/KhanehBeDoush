# KhanehBeDoush

KhanehBeDoush is a real estate website developed during the Spring 2018 semester at the University of Tehran. It was the web development project for the course Internet Engineering taught by [Dr Khosravi](http://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~r.khosravi). The theme project was divided into multiple phases each incrementally refining and adding features. 

The frontend is developed using React, while there are two backend implementations: one with Java Servlets and the other using Node Js. There is a folder for each implementation at the root of the repository.
